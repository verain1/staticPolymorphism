Q: What is the difference between function overloading and static polymorphism

When we design the application having multiple methods with the same names and passing different type/ number of parameters
this process is said to be function overloading.  //The return types doesn't matter.

"Association of an object with overloaded methods(more than one method) is said to be static polymorphism"

**Association of an object with single method is said to be early binding.

**If same object calls 2 or more methods, this is static polymorphism.
**If one object calls 1 method only, it is erly binding.
**If one object calls 1 method multiple times, it is early polymorphism only!



***Calling multiple methods of different names with same object is said to be early binding(Not static polymorphism).
